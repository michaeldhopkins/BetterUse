Welcome to BetterUse!
BetterUse suggests more awesome things than what you're probably doing on Facebook, Tumblr, LinkedIn, etc.

To use it, download betteruse.crx and install it in Chrome. Currently you have to click the inscrutable icon to see the suggestion.

TODO:
* Add many more sites
* Random quotes for sites
* Inject BetterUse into sites
* (eventually) stop storing all quotes in an object and start using a simple API.
